Note for the web site:  the purpose of "sqlconnect-example.php" is to maintain privacy of the database access credentials; it should be copied to the web server, renamed to "sqlconnect.php", and then edited to contain the actual username etc.  The resulting sqlconnect.php should NOT then be included in the github source.
